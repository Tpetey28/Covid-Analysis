# Covid-Analysis

For this project, I am utilizing data found on https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths which tracks many important data points as they relate to Covid-19.

The goal for this project is to analyze covid-19 in several ways. In the SQL file included in this repo, I am playing around with the data and splicing it up looking for ideas to incorporate into a tableau visualization and dashboard. I end up creating a few views to show the relationships between vaccinations and death by country and continent. Another view created highlights the vaccination count by country by day to give us a look at which countries were most efficient in getting the vaccine out.

Please have a look at my SQL code included here, as well as my Tableau dashboard by following the link below.
